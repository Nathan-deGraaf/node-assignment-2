      <p>I was born in Lloydminster, SK in 1999.  My family didnâ€™t have a lot of money when I was growing up, eating dinners of shake-and-bake chicken and Lipton noodles. School was never my forte, and most would describe me as a problem child. I was never interested in academics and gravitated towards artistic courses. Like the music programs (especially Jazz) the performing arts and community work. I moved from Lloydminster and complete my education in Airdrie, AB. </p>

      <h3>High School</h3>
      <article><img class="floatpic2" src="./pics/hschild.jpg" alt="self photo of nathan"></article>
      <p>After beginning in the concert music program in elementary, I instantly fell in love with music. By the time I was in 10th grade, I rose to be the lead soloist in the Jazz Band and did gigs at almost all community events playing alto saxophone.  aside from working in the Jazz band, I also did charity work with the Sheldon Kennedy Advocacy Center in Calgary. Including doing a charity livestream where I helped raise $1,000.00 for their cause. Despite hating academics, I graduated high school in 2017 with a lot under my belt, being a lead in band, and having taken my German B2, meaning I'm (technically) fluent in the German language. And a following on both YouTube and Twitch. </p>

      <h3>After Highschool</h3>
      <article><img class="floatpic1" src="./pics/yadult.jpg" alt="nathan kneeling on rocks"></article>
      <p>Shortly after graduating, I moved away from Airdrie with my girlfriend to a small town in Ontario called Fort Frances, directly on the Rainy River, and 3 hours west of Thunder Bay. During my time there I worked full time as a receiving supervisor and later became an assistant store manager for a Warehouse One clothing store. Because there was little to do in the town, I turned to computers to keep myself entertained, taking a small Udemy course in programming basics and front-end development.  doing these courses only scratched the surface and grabbed my curiosity, after 3 months of self-learning, I decided that it was what I wanted as my career. Fast forward 6 months later, and I'm now a student at SAIT polytechnic in Calgary, AB for a Web Developer course, never looking back. </p>
