				| RunicFreak is my online handle, specifically for gaming, and entertainment purposes. I have been streaming on twitch for 4 years now, mainly just having fun playing games. Some people don’t understand the purpose of streaming, and to what end it has a use. However, I use it as an escape from boredom. Because I don’t have a lot of people to play games with online, having a live audience while I'm playing make it more fun. Having an audience while its live creates a more competitive gaming experience as well, due to instant feedback from your actions.

				| Although streaming has been a fruitless effort, I had the ability to raise $1000 for the Sheldon Kennedy Advocacy Center through the twitch platform, as well as grow a (small) following that regularly watch. Due to the constant talking during a stream it has also helped with my public speaking skills and increase my sense of creativity. Due to creating thumbnails and looking into the often overlooked to find a joke. Because of these small facts, I don’t think I'll be stopping my streams anytime soon. And I hope I never want to in the future. Stay freaky.
